<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

<p>
    <em> This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.</em>

    It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that
    have read over the years.

    Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)<br>
    175g of tahini<br>
    6 sundried tomatoes<br>
    Half a red pepper<br>
    A pinch of cayenne pepper<br>
    1 clove of garlic<br>
    A dash of olive oil
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>O<sup>3</sup><mark> <del>Remove</del> <ins>the skin</ins> from the garlic, and chop coarselya</mark><br>
   Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely
    Add all the ingredients into a food processor<br>  &lt;  &apos;
    
    
    &quot <br>
    Process all the ingredients into a paste.
    If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time
    If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time<br>

    For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
    chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
</p>

<h2>Storage</h2>

<p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've
    made
    it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.<br>

    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
